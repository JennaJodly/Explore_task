    CSS Units:
       -CSS has seveeral different units for expressing a length.
       -length values such as width,margin,padding,fontsize..
       -two types
          -absolute units(these units are fixed and a length expressed in these will appear exactly that size.
          Its not recommended to use on screen becoz screen sizes may vary so much.However they can be used if the output medium is known.)
            -eg:cm,mm,in,px,pt,pc
          -reltaive(This units specify the length relative to another length property)   
            -eg:em,rem 
            em:
               relative to the font size of the element.(2em means 2 times of the current file)
            
            rem:
              Root em. It doesn't take from the parent element instead it takes from the root.   
    
    DISPLAY PROPERTY:
        display:inherit
          -this keyword causes the element to take the computed value of the property from its parent.

        display:initial  
           -which applies the default value of a property to an element.
